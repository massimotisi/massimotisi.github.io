abstract = {The necessity of manipulating very large amounts of data and the wide availability of computational resources on the Cloud is boosting the popularity of distributed computing in industry. The applicability of model-driven engineering in such scenarios is hampered today by the lack of an efficient model-persistence framework for distributed computing. In this paper we present NeoEMF/HBase, a persistence backend for the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) built on top of the Apache HBase data store. Model distribution is hidden from client applications, that are transparently provided with the model elements they navigate. Access to remote model elements is decentralized, avoiding the bottleneck of a single access point. The persistence model is based on key-value stores that allow for efficient on-demand model persistence.},

abstract = {With the growing size and complexity of systems under design, industry needs a generation of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) tools, especially model query and transformation, with the proven capability to handle large-scale scenarios. While researchers are proposing several technical solutions in this sense, the community lacks a set of shared scalability benchmarks, that would simplify quantitative assessment of advancements and enable crossevaluation of different proposals. Benchmarks in previous work have been synthesized to stress specific features of model management, lacking both generality and industrial validity. In this paper, we initiate an effort to define a set of shared benchmarks, gathering queries and transformations from real-world MDE case studies. We make these case available to community evaluation via a public MDE benchmark repository.},

abstract = {Scalability is a main obstacle for applying Model-Driven Engineering to reverse engineering, or to any other activity manipulating large models. Existing solutions to persist and query large models are currently inefficient and strongly linked to memory availability. In this paper, we propose a memory unload strategy for Neo4EMF, a persistence layer built on top of the Eclipse Modeling Framework and based on a Neo4j database backend. Our solution allows us to partially unload a model during the execution of a query by using a periodical dirty saving mechanism and transparent reloading. Our experiments show that this approach enables to query large models in a restricted amount of memory with an acceptable performance.},

Additional research and development is imperative in order to enable MDE to remain relevant with industrial practice and to continue delivering its widely recognised productivity, quality, and maintainability benefits. Achieving scalability in modelling and MDE involves being able to construct large models and domain-specific languages in a systematic manner, enabling teams of modellers to construct and refine large models in a collaborative manner, advancing the state of the art in model querying and transformations tools so that they can cope with large models (of the scale of millions of model elements), and providing an infrastructure for efficient storage, indexing and retrieval of large models.

@article{Clasen2012,
abstract = {Model transformations are widely used by Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) platforms to apply different kinds of operations over models, such as model translation, evolution or composition. However, existing solutions are not designed to handle very large models (VLMs), thus facing scalability issues. Coupling MDE with cloud-based platforms may help solving these issues. Since cloud-based platforms are relatively new, researchers still need to investigate if/how/when MDE solutions can benefit from them. In this paper, we investigate the problem of transforming VLMs in the Cloud by addressing the two phases of 1) model storage and 2) model transformation execution in the Cloud. For both aspects we identify a set of research questions, possible solutions and probable challenges researchers may face.},

Based on our tool development experience in the AtlanMod research team, specially regarding the evolution of our ATL model transformation tool, we argue in this paper that the best solution for research teams aiming to create high-quality and widely-used tools is to industrialize their research prototypes through a partnership with a technology provider.},
