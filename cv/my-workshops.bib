Based on our tool development experience in the AtlanMod research team, specially regarding the evolution of our ATL model transformation tool, we argue in this paper that the best solution for research teams aiming to create high-quality and widely-used tools is to industrialize their research prototypes through a partnership with a technology provider.},

Additional research and development is imperative in order to enable MDE to remain relevant with industrial practice and to continue delivering its widely recognised productivity, quality, and maintainability benefits. Achieving scalability in modelling and MDE involves being able to construct large models and domain-specific languages in a systematic manner, enabling teams of modellers to construct and refine large models in a collaborative manner, advancing the state of the art in model querying and transformations tools so that they can cope with large models (of the scale of millions of model elements), and providing an infrastructure for efficient storage, indexing and retrieval of large models. This paper attempts to provide a research roadmap for these aspects of scalability in MDE and outline directions for work in this emerging research area. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

	abstract = {The necessity of manipulating very large amounts of data and the wide availability of computational resources on the Cloud is boosting the popularity of distributed computing in industry. The applicability of model-driven engineering in such scenarios is hampered today by the lack of an efficient model-persistence framework for distributed computing. In this paper we present NeoEMF/HBase, a persistence backend for the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) built on top of the Apache HBase data store. Model distribution is hidden from client applications, that are transparently provided with the model elements they navigate. Access to remote model elements is decentralized, avoiding the bottleneck of a single access point. The persistence model is based on key-value stores that allow for efficient on-demand model persistence.},

We argue that a lazy evaluation semantics is beneficial in some model-driven engineering scenarios for: i) lowering evaluation times on very large models; ii) simplifying expressions on models by using infinite data structures (e.g., infinite models); iii) increasing the reusability of OCL libraries. We implement the approach on the ATL virtual machine EMFTVM.},

	abstract = {? 2015 ACM.The Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm has been successfully embraced for manufacturing maintainable software in several domains while decreasing costs and efforts. One of its principal concepts is rule-based Model Transformation (MT) that enables an automated processing of models for different intentions. The user-friendly syntax of MT languages is designed for allowing users to specify and execute these operations in an effortless manner. Existing MT engines, however, are incapable of accomplishing transformation operations in an acceptable time while facing complex transformations. Worse, against large amount of data, these tools crash throwing an out of memory exception. In this paper, we introduce ATL-MR, a tool to automatically distribute the execution of model transformations written in a popular MT language, ATL, on top of MapReduce.We briefly present an overview of our approach, we describe the changes with respect to the standard ATL transformation engine, finally, we experimentally show the scalability of this solution.},

Existing solutions to persist and query large models are currently inefficient and strongly linked to memory availability. In this paper, we propose a memory unload strategy for Neo4EMF, a persistence layer built on top of the Eclipse Modeling Framework and based on a Neo4j database backend. Our solution allows us to partially unload a model during the execution of a query by using a periodical dirty saving mechanism and transparent reloading. Our experiments show that this approach enables to query large models in a restricted amount of memory with an acceptable performance.},

However, existing solutions are not designed to handle very large models (VLMs), thus facing scalability issues. Coupling MDE with cloud-based platforms may help solving these issues. Since cloud-based platforms are relatively new, researchers still need to investigate if/how/when MDE solutions can benefit from them. In this paper, we investigate the problem of transforming VLMs in the Cloud by addressing the two phases of 1) model storage and 2) model transformation execution in the Cloud. For both aspects we identify a set of research questions, possible solutions and probable challenges researchers may face.},

Our injector automatically instruments the code, executes it and captures a model of the execution behavior of the program, coupled with the model of the program structure. We use the trace injection mechanism for model-driven impact analysis on test sets.

This problem also exists in the realm of executable domain-speciﬁc modeling languages, where end-users create models conforming to a given meta-model and execute them with little knowledge about their operational semantic and related energy consumption. In this work, we propose a domainspeciﬁc language for decorating meta-models of executable languages with platform-speciﬁc energy estimation formulas. We also extend the GEMOC execution engine to dynamically perform energy estimations on any executable model conforming to the decorated meta-model. The energy estimation model deﬁned can then be easily adapted to other models and platforms, without requiring any measurement tooling or knowledge from the enduser.},

	abstract = {Low-code development platforms are taking an important place in the model-driven engineering ecosystem, raising new challenges,
among which transparent efficiency or scalability. Indeed, the increasing size of models leads to difficulties in interacting with
them efficiently. To tackle this scalability issue, some tools are built upon specific computational strategies exploiting reactivity,
or parallelism. However, their performances may vary depending on the specific nature of their usage. Choosing the most suitable
computational strategy for a given usage is a difficult task which should be automated. Besides, the most efficient solutions may
be obtained by the use of several strategies at the same time. This paper motivates the need for a transparent multi-strategy execution
mode for model-management operations. We present an overview of the different computational strategies used in the model-driven
engineering ecosystem, and use a running example to introduce the benefits of mixing strategies for performing a single computation.
This example helps us present our design ideas for a multi-strategy model-management system. e code-related and DevOps challenges that emerged from this analysis are also presented.},

	abstract = {Context. Several activities in model-driven engineering (MDE), like model transformation testing, would require the availability of big sets of realistic models. However, the community has failed so far in producing large model repositories, and the lack of freely available industrial models has been raised as one of the most important problems in MDE. Consequently, MDE researchers have developed various tools and methods to generate models using different approaches, such as graph grammar, partitioning, and random generation. However, these tools rarely focus on producing new models, considering their realism.},

	abstract = {Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) help manage the growing complexity of systems by facilitating their description and execution or simulation via tailored languages. A large part of the development costs of a DSL comes from building the associated tools it requires, such as an editor or a debugger. To reduce these costs, the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) enable the creation of generic tooling interfaces which rely on standardized services exposed by languages. However, as these protocols have been designed for General Purpose Languages (GPLs), their applicability to DSLs has no yet been extensively studied. In this paper, we analyze both LSP and DAP, with an emphasis regarding their relevance for the development of tooling for DSLs. We provide both a highlevel insight into these protocols, such as a dependency graph of their services, and a more fine-grained qualitative analysis of each service. We show that while some services defined by these two protocols can be provided by any DSL, others make strong assumptions on the concepts that should be part of the considered DSL. Conversely, domain-specific concepts available in some DSLs are not exploitable through these protocols, thus reducing the capabilities of generic tools.},
