  abstract = {? 2015 ACM.The Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm has been successfully embraced for manufacturing maintainable software in several domains while decreasing costs and efforts. One of its principal concepts is rule-based Model Transformation (MT) that enables an automated processing of models for different intentions. The user-friendly syntax of MT languages is designed for allowing users to specify and execute these operations in an effortless manner. Existing MT engines, however, are incapable of accomplishing transformation operations in an acceptable time while facing complex transformations. Worse, against large amount of data, these tools crash throwing an out of memory exception. In this paper, we introduce ATL-MR, a tool to automatically distribute the execution of model transformations written in a popular MT language, ATL, on top of MapReduce.We briefly present an overview of our approach, we describe the changes with respect to the standard ATL transformation engine, finally, we experimentally show the scalability of this solution.},

While researchers are proposing several technical solutions in this sense, the community lacks a set of shared scalability benchmarks, that would simplify quantitative assessment of advancements and enable crossevaluation of different proposals. Benchmarks in previous work have been synthesized to stress specific features of model management, lacking both generality and industrial validity. In this paper, we initiate an effort to define a set of shared benchmarks, gathering queries and transformations from real-world MDE case studies.

Frameworks like MoDisco inject the program structure into a model, available for further processing by query and transformation tools, e.g., for program understanding, reverse-engineering, modernization. In this paper we present our first steps towards extending MoDisco with capabilities for dynamic program analysis. We build an injector for program execution traces, one of the basic blocks of dynamic analysis. Our injector automatically instruments the code, executes it and captures a model of the execution behavior of the program, coupled with the model of the program structure. We use the trace injection mechanism for model-driven impact analysis on test sets. We identify some scalability issues that remain to be solved, providing a case study for future efforts in improving performance of model-management tools.},

Most developers code and run their applications in an energy oblivious manner, mostly because of a lack of energy-related knowledge about their system. This problem also exists in the realm of executable domain-specific modeling languages, where end-users create models conforming to a given meta-model and execute them with little knowledge about their operational semantic and related energy consumption. In this work, we propose a domainspecific language for decorating meta-models of executable languages with platform-specific energy estimation formulas. We also extend the GEMOC execution engine to dynamically perform energy estimations on any executable model conforming to the decorated meta-model. The energy estimation model defined can then be easily adapted to other models and platforms, without requiring any measurement tooling or knowledge from the enduser.},

However, existing solutions are not designed to handle very large models (VLMs), thus facing scalability issues. Coupling MDE with cloud-based platforms may help solving these issues. Since cloud-based platforms are relatively new, researchers still need to investigate if/how/when MDE solutions can benefit from them. In this paper, we investigate the problem of transforming VLMs in the Cloud by addressing the two phases of 1) model storage and 2) model transformation execution in the Cloud.

  abstract = {Low-code development platforms are taking an important place in the model-driven engineering ecosystem, raising new challenges, among which transparent efficiency or scalability. Indeed, the increasing size of models leads to difficulties in interacting with them efficiently. To tackle this scalability issue, some tools are built upon specific computational strategies exploiting reactivity, or parallelism. However, their performances may vary depending on the specific nature of their usage. Choosing the most suitable computational strategy for a given usage is a difficult task which should be automated. Besides, the most efficient solutions may be obtained by the use of several strategies at the same time. This paper motivates the need for a transparent multi-strategy execution mode for model-management operations. We present an overview of the different computational strategies used in the model-driven engineering ecosystem, and use a running example to introduce the benefits of mixing strategies for performing a single computation. This example helps us present our design ideas for a multi-strategy model-management system. e code-related and DevOps challenges that emerged from this analysis are also presented.},
