abstract = {In the last years, there has been an increasing interest for Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) solutions in the Web. Web-based modeling solutions can leverage on better support for distributed management (i.e., the Cloud) and collaboration. However, current modeling environments and frameworks are usually restricted to desktop-based scenarios and therefore their capabilities to move to the Web are still very limited. In this paper we present an approach to generate Web APIs out of models, thus paving the way for managing models and collaborating on them online. The approach, called EMF-REST, takes Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) data models as input and generates Web APIs following the REST principles and relying on well-known libraries and standards, thus facilitating its comprehension and maintainability. Also, EMF-REST integrates model and Web-specific features to provide model validation and security capabilities, respectively, to the generated API.},

abstract = {? Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.Until the recent adoption of fUML, UML has lacked standard execution semantics. However, parts of UML models have always been executable: OCL expressions. They may notably be used to express contracts (i.e., invariants, pre- and post-conditions), to define side-effect free operations, and to specify how to compute derived features. Nonetheless, although fUML is partly inspired by OCL (notably for primitive behaviors), its specification does not consider interoperability with OCL expressions. Moreover, the semantics of OCL is specified independently of (f)UML, and their implementations are separate execution engines, hampering all global activities (e.g., analysis, optimization, debugging). This paper explores a possible integration approach of OCL and fUML: by transforming (i.e., compiling) OCL expressions into fUML activities we obtain a unified executable model. With this approach, operations specified in OCL can be called, and getters can be generated for derived features. Preconditions (resp. postconditions) can be automatically executed before (resp. after) the execution of their contextual operations. A precise semantics for invariant evaluation can be specified in fUML. Thanks to this work, OCL may also be seen as a functional counterpart to Alf.},

One of its principal concepts is rule-based Model Transformation (MT) that enables an automated processing of models for different intentions. The user-friendly syntax of MT languages is designed for allowing users to specify and execute these operations in an effortless manner. Existing MT engines, however, are incapable of accomplishing transformation operations in an acceptable time while facing complex transformations. Worse, against large amount of data, these tools crash throwing an out of memory exception.

Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.Developers in modern general-purpose programming languages create reusable code libraries by encapsulating them in Applications Programming Interfaces (APIs). Domain-specific languages (DSLs) can be developed as an alternative method for code abstraction and distribution, sometimes preferable to APIs because of their expressivity and tailored development environment. However the cost of implementing a fully functional development environment for a DSL is generally higher. In this paper we propose DSLit, a prototype-tool that, given an existing API, reduces the cost of developing a corresponding DSL by analyzing the API, automatically generating a semantically equivalent DSL with its complete development environment, and allowing for user customization. To build this bridge between the API and DSL technical spaces we make use of existing Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques, further promoting the vision of MDE as a unifying technical space.},

abstract = {The progressive industrial adoption of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is fostering the development of large tool ecosystems like the Eclipse Modeling project. These tools are built on top of a set of base technologies that have been primarily designed for small-scale scenarios, where models are manually developed. In particular, efficient runtime manipulation for large-scale models is an under-studied problem and this is hampering the application of MDE to several industrial scenarios. In this paper we introduce and evaluate a map-based persistence model for MDE tools. We use this model to build a transparent persistence layer for modeling tools, on top of a map-based database engine. The layer can be plugged into the Eclipse Modeling Framework, lowering execution times and memory consumption levels of other existing approaches. Empirical tests are performed based on a typical industrial scenario, model-driven reverse engineering, where very large software models originate from the analysis of massive code bases. The layer is freely distributed and can be immediately used for enhancing the scalability of any existing Eclipse Modeling tool.},

One of the central operations in MDE is rule-based model transformation (MT). It is used to specify manipulation operations over structured data coming in the form of model graphs. However, being based on computationally expensive operations like subgraph isomorphism, MT tools are facing ibues on both memory occupancy and execution time while dealing with the increasing model size and complexity. One way to overcome these ibues is to exploit the wide availability of distributed clusters in the Cloud for the distributed execution of MT. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically distribute the execution of model transformations written in a popular MT language, ATL, on top of a well-known distributed programming model, MapReduce. We show how the execution semantics of ATL can be aligned with the MapReduce computation model. We describe the extensions to the ATL transformation engine to enable distribution, and we experimentally demonstrate the scalability of this solution in a reverse-engineering scenario.},

The central idea of abstraction makes model-driven engineering (MDE) a promising approach in such contexts, but current tools do not scale to very large models (VLMs): already the task of storing and accessing VLMs from a persisting support is currently inefficient. In this paper we propose a scalable persistence layer for the de-facto standard MDE framework EMF. The layer exploits the efficiency of graph databases in storing and accessing graph structures, as EMF models are. A preliminary experimentation shows that typical queries in reverse-engineering EMF models have good performance on such persistence layer, compared to file-based backends. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {Model transformations are an integral part of several computing systems that manipulate interconnected graphs of objects called models in an input domain specified by a metamodel and a set of invariants. Test models are used to look for faults in a transformation. A test model contains a specific set of objects, their interconnections and values for their attributes. Can we automatically generate an effective set of test models using knowledge from the transformation? We present a white-box testing approach that uses static analysis to guide the automatic generation of test inputs for transformations. Our static analysis uncovers knowledge about how the input model elements are accessed by transformation operations. This information is called the input metamodel footprint due to the transformation. We transform footprint, input metamodel, its invariants, and transformation pre-conditions to a constraint satisfaction problem in Alloy. We solve the problem to generate sets of test models containing traces of the footprint. Are these test models effective? With the help of a case study transformation we evaluate the effectiveness of these test inputs. We use mutation analysis to show that the test models generated from footprints are more effective (97.62{\%} avg. mutation score) in detecting faults than previously developed approaches based on input domain coverage criteria (89.9{\%} avg.) and unguided generation (70.1{\%} avg.). ? 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Testers often use partial knowledge to build test models. This knowledge comes from sources such as requirements, known faults, existing inputs, and execution traces. In Model-Driven Engineering, test inputs are models executed by model transformations. Modelers build them using partial knowledge while meticulously satisfying several well-formedness rules imposed by the modelling language. This manual process is tedious and language constraints can force users to create complex models even for representing simple knowledge. In this paper, we want to simplify the development of test models by presenting an integrated methodology and semi-automated tool that allow users to build only small partial test models directly representing their testing intent. We argue that partial models are more readable and maintainable and can be automatically completed to full input models while considering language constraints. We validate this approach by evaluating the size and fault-detecting effectiveness of partial models compared to traditionally-built test models. We show that they can detect the same bugs/faults with a greatly reduced development effort. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

The "vertical" transformations composing the two streams are kept aligned, by means of "horizontal" mappings that can be applied after a change in the modeling framework (e.g., an update in the {\{}PIM{\}}-to-code transformation due to a change in the target deployment technology).

abstract = {Model Driven Engineering is extending its reach beyond the generation of code from Platform Independent Models ({\{}PIMs{\}}), to all the phases of the software life-cycle. This paper presents an approach to exploit {\{}PIMs{\}} to ease regression testing, whereby developers can record and replay testing sessions and investigate testing failures on the application model, thanks to traceability links automatically inserted in the generated code. The core of the approach is a modified version of the model transformation for code generation, obtained by applying a Higher Order Transformation ({\{}HOT{\}}), that is a transformation that takes in input a transformation (the original code generator) and produces another transformation (the augmented code generator). The {\{}HOT{\}} weaves into the code generator additional rules producing traceability clues that help developers link any error to the model features likely to cause it. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The Model Driven Architecture aims at the integration of different modeling languages, artifacts and tools in a unified technical space. Pre-existing development methodologies based on Domain Specific Languages (DSL) require a complex process to benefit from this integration. After a MOF metamodel for the DSL is defined, there is no standard methodology to move legacy models and tools to the new architecture. This paper proposes a general model-driven integration procedure for pre-MDA DSLs. The procedure, given the definition of suitable model transformations, is completely automatic. The proposed framework is fully implemented, in a way independent of the specific DSL that must be transformed. As a case study, a toolsuite based on WebML, a DSL for designing Web applications, is bridged to MDA.},

abstract = {Conceptual modelling is a promising approach for Web application development, thanks to innovative {\{}CASE{\}} tools that can transform high-level specifications into executable code. So far, the impact of conceptual modelling has been evaluated mostly on analysis and design. This paper addresses its influence on testing, one of the most important and effort-consuming phases, by investigating how the traditional notions of testing carry over to the problem of verifying the correctness of Web applications produced by model-driven code generators. The paper examines an industrial case study carried out in a software factory where code generators are produced for a commercial Web {\{}CASE{\}} tool.},
