  abstract = {Cloud-based low-code development platforms such as Google's AppSheet, Microsoft's PowerApps, OutSystems and Mendix have become increasingly popular over the last few years, owing to an increasing demand for bespoke, cost-efficient and reliable data-intensive (e.g., back-office) software solutions. Low-code development platforms are model-driven at their heart. Hence, closer interaction and cross-pollination are highly beneficial for the low-code and model-driven engineering communities. The Low-Code workshop aims to bring together vendors and users of low-code development platforms with model-driven engineering researchers and practitioners and explore opportunities for technology and experience transfer and collaboration between them.},
