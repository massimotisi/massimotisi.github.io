\subsection*{Short bio}

Since 2010, I hold an Associate Professor position in the Department of Automation, Production and Computer Science at IMT Atlantique (formerly Ecole des Mines de Nantes). I’m team leader of the Naomod team (LS2N, UMR CNRS 6004). I obtained the Habilitation to Direct Research (HDR) in December 2023.

\smallskip

I obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano in 2005 (100/100) and my Ph.D. in Information Engineering (grade A) in April 2009, with a thesis on Model Transformations for Artifact Generation in Model-Driven Environments (advisor prof. Piero Fraternali).

Since the beginning of my career, my research focused on the design, implementation and evaluation of novel methods and tools for modeling software systems and reasoning on software models. The scientific work, which resulted in high-profile publications, has always been supported by substantial implementation and demonstration efforts, and by a continuos interaction with industry. While during my doctoral studies I was focused on modeling a precise application domain (data-intensive Web applications), moving to IMT Atlantique I expanded the spectrum of modeled applications, and recently included cyber-physical systems and digital twins. 

During my doctoral studies I have been visiting researcher at the McGill university (Montreal, Canada, 2007), where I came in contact with multi-paradigm heterogeneous modeling. Later I have been several times a visiting researcher at the National Institute of Informatics (NII) in Tokyo, Japan, where I collaborated on advancing the state of the art in bidirectional transformations.

Recently I worked at advancing the state of the art on low-code platforms, i.e. development platforms in the cloud that use software modeling to enable application development by end users and domain experts. I contribute at improving their scalability and integration with information systems, AI components, and digital twins. 

\subsection*{Publications and visibility}

I am widely recognized as an expert in model transformation, notably for introducing higher-order model transformations, and for my contributions to the ATL language since 2010. In particular, my article "On the Use of Higher-Order Model Transformations" has collected 268 citations since 2009. I have been cited more than 2500 times, and have an h-index of 26 (August 2024 - Google Scholar). I am also recognized as a leading researcher on low-code platforms, since I was among the first academics to work on low-code, by coordinating an European project, organizing an ongoing workshop series, and publishing top level publications on the subject.
