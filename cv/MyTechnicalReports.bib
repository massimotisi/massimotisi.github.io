abstract = {In the last years, there has been an increasing interest for Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) solutions in the Web. Web-based modeling solutions can leverage on better support for distributed management (i.e., the Cloud) and collaboration. However, current modeling environments and frameworks are usually restricted to desktop-based scenarios and therefore their capabilities to move to the Web are still very limited. In this paper we present an approach to generate Web APIs out of models, thus paving the way for managing models and collaborating on them online. The approach, called EMF-REST, takes Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) data models as input and generates Web APIs following the REST principles and relying on well-known libraries and standards, thus facilitating its comprehension and maintainability. Also, EMF-REST integrates model and Web-specific features to provide model validation and security capabilities, respectively, to the generated API.},

abstract = {Several model-to-model transformation languages have been primarily designed to easily address the syntactic and semantic translation of read-only input models towards write-only output models. While this approach has been proven successful in many practical cases, it is not directly applicable to transformations that need to modify their source models, like refactorings. In this paper we investigate the application of a model-to-model transformation language to in-place transformations, by providing a systematic view of the problem, comparing alternative solutions and proposing a transformation semantics to address this problem in ATL.},
