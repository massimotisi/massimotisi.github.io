  abstract = {MDE has been successfully adopted in the production of software for several domains. As the models that need to be handled in MDE grow in scale, it becomes necessary to design scalable algorithms for model transformation (MT) as well as suitable frameworks for storing and retrieving models efficiently. One way to cope with scalability is to exploit the wide availability of distributed clusters in the Cloud for the parallel execution of MT. However, because of the dense interconnectivity of models and the complexity of transformation logic, the efficient use of these solutions in distributed model processing and persistence is not trivial.},

The RT time becomes problematic as the number of test cases is growing. Regression test selection (RTS) aims at running only the test cases that have been impacted by recent changes. RTS reduces the duration of regression testing and hence its cost. In this paper, we present a model-driven approach for RTS. Execution traces are gathered at runtime, and injected in a static source-code model. We use this resulting model to identify and select all the test cases that have been impacted by changes between two revisions of the program. Our MDE approach allows modularity in the granularity of changes considered. In addition, it offers better reusability than existing RTS techniques: the trace model is persistent and standardised. Furthermore, it enables more interoperability with other model-driven tools, enabling further analysis at different levels of abstraction (e.g. energy consumption).},

While recent advancements have enabled automatic Hoare-style verification for non-trivial MTs, there are certain verification tasks (e.g. induction) that are intrinsically difficult to automate. Existing tools that aim at simplifying the interactive verification of MTs typically translate the MT specification (e.g. in ATL) and properties to prove (e.g. in OCL) into an interactive theorem prover. However, since the MT specification and proof phases happen in separate languages, the proof developer needs a detailed knowledge of the translation logic. Naturally, any error in the MT translation could cause unsound verification, i.e. the MT executed in the original environment may have different semantics from the verified MT.},

LCDPs are advertised as visual development platforms, typically running on the cloud, reducing the need for manual coding and also targeting non-professional programmers. Since LCDPs share many of the goals and features of model-driven engineering approaches, it is a common point of debate whether lowcode is just a new buzzword for model-driven technologies, or whether the two terms refer to genuinely distinct approaches. To contribute to this discussion, in this expert-voice paper, we compare and contrast low-code and model-driven approaches, identifying their differences and commonalities, analysing their strong and weak points, and proposing directions for crosspollination.},

Web-based modeling solutions can leverage on better support for distributed management (i.e., the Cloud) and collaboration.

In this paper we present an approach to generate Web APIs out of models, thus paving the way for managing models and collaborating on them online. The approach, called EMF-REST, takes Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) data models as input and generates Web APIs following the REST principles and relying on well-known libraries and standards, thus facilitating its comprehension and maintainability. Also, EMF-REST integrates model and Web-specific features to provide model validation and security capabilities, respectively, to the generated API.},

  abstract = {Interactive debuggers are established tools used by developers to understand programs and localize faults. They are equally valuable in the context of model-driven development, when working on executable behavioral models. However, development costs of interactive debuggers for Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) can be significant. In order to mitigate these costs, several reusable DSL-agnostic debugging solutions have been proposed. We argue that the applicability of these solutions is limited by being tied to a fixed set of debugging services, a specific language engineering approach, or a particular user interface. In this paper, we present a novel approach to provide interactive debugging services for executable DSLs through a reusable generic architecture. We propose a protocol allowing a generic interactive debugger to communicate with heterogeneous DSL runtimes, both for controlling the execution and for configuring the debugger with domain-specific breakpoints. The proposed debugger can itself be controlled using a reinterpretation of the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), for an effortless integration in existing Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that support it. Using a prototype implementation based on JSON-RPC and two heterogeneous DSL runtimes, we show that our approach provides an off-the-shelf reusable interactive debugger that supports meaningful domain-specific breakpoints, and that can be used with minimal effort within an IDE such as Visual Studio Code.},

This paper focuses on the use of PIMs to support automation in the regression testing phase of a system; the proposed framework lets developers record and replay testing sessions and investigate testing failures at the level of their PIMs; this is made possible by traceability links automatically weaved into the generated code, whereby developers can follow application execution at the model level. Such traceability links are created by a modified version of the code generation transformation, automatically produced by means of a Higher-Order Transformation (HOT). A HOT is a transformation that takes as input a transformation (the original code generator) and creates another transformation (the code generator capable of producing traceability links). The HOT weaves into the code generator additional rules producing traceability clues that help developers link any error to the model features likely to cause it. This approach is particularly helpful in the Web context, where code generation transformations must follow changes in the technology and presentation styles. Using HOTs ensures the automatic evolution of the transformation for traceability links when the code generation transformation changes. \&copy; Rinton Press.},

This paper tries to clarify and visualize the space of design choices for bidirectional transformations from an MDE point of view, in the form of a feature model. The selected list of existing approaches are characterized by mapping them to the feature model.

Such models are typically represented as a graph, which is queried to gain insight into the modelled system. Often, the results of these queries need to be adjusted according to updated requirements and are therefore a subject of maintenance activities. It is thus necessary to support writing model queries with adequate languages. However, in order to stay meaningful, the analysis results need to be refreshed as soon as the underlying models change. Therefore, a good execution speed is mandatory in order to cope with frequent model changes. In this paper, we propose a benchmark to assess model query technologies in the presence of model change sequences in the domain of social media. We present solutions to this benchmark in a variety of 11 different tools and compare them with respect to explicitness of incrementalization, asymptotic complexity and performance.},

In this paper we propose a reactive paradigm for programming model transformations, and we implement a reactive model-transformation engine. We argue that this paradigm facilitates the development of autonomous model-driven systems that react to update and request events from the host application by identifying and performing only the needed computation. We implement such approach by providing a reactive engine for the ATL transformation language. We evaluate the usage scenarios that this paradigm supports and we experimentally measure its ability to reduce computation time in transformation-based applications.},
