abstract = {Abstract Model-driven applications may maintain large networks of structured data models and transformations among them. The development of such applications is complicated by the need to reflect on the whole network any runtime update performed on models or transformation logic. If not carefully designed, the execution of such updates may be computationally expensive. In this paper we propose a reactive paradigm for programming model transformations, and we implement a reactive model-transformation engine. We argue that this paradigm facilitates the development of autonomous model-driven systems that react to update and request events from the host application by identifying and performing only the needed computation. We implement such approach by providing a reactive engine for the {\{}ATL{\}} transformation language. We evaluate the usage scenarios that this paradigm supports and we experimentally measure its ability to reduce computation time in transformation-based applications.},

abstract = {Bidirectional model transformation is a key technology in model-driven engineering (MDE), when two models that can change over time have to be kept constantly consistent with each other. While several model transformation tools include at least a partial support to bidirectionality, it is not clear how these bidirectional capabilities relate to each other and to similar classical problems in computer science, from the view update problem in databases to bidirectional graph transformations. This paper tries to clarify and visualize the space of design choices for bidirectional transformations from an MDE point of view, in the form of a feature model. The selected list of existing approaches are characterized by mapping them to the feature model. Then, the feature model is used to highlight some unexplored research lines in bidirectional transformations.},

@article{Fraternali2011,
abstract = {For Model-Driven Engineering to become widely accepted by developers, it is necessary that its principles and techniques be applied not only to the generation of code from Plat- form Independent Models (PIMs), but more generally to all the phases of the software life-cycle. This paper focuses on the use of PIMs to support automation in the regression testing phase of a system; the proposed framework lets developers record and replay testing sessions and investigate testing failures at the level of their PIMs; this is made possible by traceability links automatically weaved into the generated code, whereby developers can follow application execution at the model level. Such traceability links are created by a modified version of the code generation transformation, automatically produced by means of a Higher-Order Transformation (HOT). A HOT is a transformation that takes as input a transformation (the original code generator) and creates another transformation (the code generator capable of producing traceability links). The HOT weaves into the code generator additional rules producing traceability clues that help developers link any error to the model features likely to cause it. This approach is particularly helpful in the Web context, where code generation transformations must follow changes in the technology and presentation styles. Using HOTs ensures the automatic evolution of the transformation for traceability links when the code generation transformation changes. {\&}copy; Rinton Press.},
