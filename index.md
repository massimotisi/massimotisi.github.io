I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Automation, Production and Computer Science of [IMT Atlantique](http://www.imt-atlantique.fr/) (France). I am co-responsible at IMT Atlantique of the [Software Engineering Apprenticeship (FIL)](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr/formation/ingenieur-apprentissage/ingenierie-logicielle). 

I'm leading the [Naomod](https://naomod.github.io/) team ([LS2N, UMR CNRS 6004](http://ls2n.fr/)). I research and teach [model-driven engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering) and [software language engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). I have contributed to the design of several tools related to the [Eclipse Modeling Project](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/), especially the [ATL transformation language](https://www.eclipse.org/atl/). I coordinated the [Lowcomote](https://lowcomote.eu/) Marie Curie European Training Network. In my previous research life I have been a member of the Database and Web Technologies group in [Politecnico di Milano](http://www.polimi.it/en/english-version/) (Italy).

In most of my current research I investigate:

* [Model Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_transformation)
* [AI-Assisted Software Engineering](https://www.google.com/search?q=AI-Assisted+Development)
* [Deductive Verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification#Approaches) for Model-Driven Engineering
* [Software Language Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)

I'm applying these techniques in the digitalization of industrial systems ([Industry 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution)).
