I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Automation, Production and Computer Science (DAPI)](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en/about/departments/dapi) of [IMT Atlantique](http://www.imt-atlantique.fr/) (Nantes, France). I am co-responsible at IMT Atlantique of the [Software Engineering Apprenticeship Specialization (FIL)](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en/study/apprenticeship-engineer/software-engineering-specialisation). 

I'm leading the [Naomod](https://naomod.github.io/) team ([LS2N, UMR CNRS 6004](http://ls2n.fr/)). I research and teach [model-driven engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering) and [software language engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). I have contributed to the design of several tools related to the [Eclipse Modeling Project](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/), especially the [ATL transformation language](https://www.eclipse.org/atl/). I coordinated the [Lowcomote](https://lowcomote.eu/) Marie Curie European Training Network. Previously I have been a member of the Databases group in [Politecnico di Milano](http://www.polimi.it/en/english-version/) (Italy).

In most of my current research I investigate:

* [Model transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_transformation)
* [AI-assisted software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence#AI-powered_code_assisting_tools)
* [Deductive verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification#Approaches) for model-driven engineering
* [Software language engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)

I'm applying these techniques in the digitalization of industrial systems ([Industry 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution)).
