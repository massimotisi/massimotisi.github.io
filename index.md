I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science of the [Ecole des Mines de Nantes](http://www.mines-nantes.fr/) (France), in the [AtlanMod](http://web.emn.fr/x-info/atlanmod/index.php?title=Main_Page) team ([Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/), [Mines Nantes](http://www.mines-nantes.fr/), [LS2N](http://ls2n.fr/)). 

I research and teach [model-driven software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering) and [domain-specific languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). I have participated to the development of several software tools around the [ATL transformation language](https://www.eclipse.org/atl/) of the [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) Modelling project.

In my previous research life I have been a proud member of the Database and Web Technologies group in [Politecnico di Milano](http://www.polimi.it/en/english-version/) (Italy).

In most of my current research I investigate:

* [Relational Model Transformation](http://web.emn.fr/x-info/atlanmod/index.php?title=Model_Transformation)
* [Domain-Specific Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
* [Model Verification](http://web.emn.fr/x-info/atlanmod/index.php?title=Model_Quality)

You will not find much about these topics in this website. The best way to have more details on my research is browsing through my [publications](publications).
