I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science of the [Institut Mines-Telecom Atlantique](http://www.imt-atlantique.fr/) (France). 

I'm deputy team leader of the [naomod](https://naomod.github.io/) team ([IMT Atlantique](http://www.imt-atlantique.fr/), [LS2N](http://ls2n.fr/)). 

Since 2019 I coordinate the [Lowcomote](https://www.lowcomote.eu/) Marie Curie European Training Network.

I research and teach [model-driven software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering) and [domain-specific languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). I have participated to the development of several software tools around the [ATL transformation language](https://www.eclipse.org/atl/) of the [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) Modeling project.

In my previous research life I have been a proud member of the Database and Web Technologies group in [Politecnico di Milano](http://www.polimi.it/en/english-version/) (Italy).

In most of my current research I investigate:

* [Model Transformation](http://web.emn.fr/x-info/atlanmod/index.php?title=Model_Transformation)
* [Deductive Verification in Model-Driven Engineering](http://web.emn.fr/x-info/atlanmod/index.php?title=Model_Quality)
* [Domain-Specific Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)

You will not find much about these topics in this website. The best way to have more details on my research is browsing through my [publications](publications).
