I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Automation, Production and Computer Science of the [IMT Atlantique](http://www.imt-atlantique.fr/) (France). 

I'm deputy team leader of the [Naomod](https://naomod.github.io/) team ([LS2N, UMR CNRS 6004](http://ls2n.fr/)). 

Since 2019 I coordinate the [Lowcomote](https://www.lowcomote.eu/) Marie Curie European Training Network.

I research and teach [model-driven engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering) and [software language engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). I have contributed to the design of several tools related to the [Eclipse Modeling Project](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/), especially the [ATL transformation language](https://www.eclipse.org/atl/).

In my previous research life I have been a proud member of the Database and Web Technologies group in [Politecnico di Milano](http://www.polimi.it/en/english-version/) (Italy).

In most of my current research I investigate:

* [Model Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_transformation)
* [Deductive Verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification#Approaches) in Model-Driven Engineering
* [Software Language Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
* [AI-Assisted Development](https://www.google.com/search?q=AI-Assisted+Development)
* Modeling of [Cyber-Physical Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system)

You will not find much about these topics in this website. The best way to have more details on my research is browsing through my [publications](publications).
